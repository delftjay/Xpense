This is to ensure its growth comes from the records of consumption and behavioral data and avoid alteration or falsification. In the future, with the blockchain distributed storage technology getting more mature, the backbone of Xpense data management chain will also be transferred or stored on blockchain distributed storage. For truly achieving decentralization, we have adopted the following technologies.":"Through the use of blockchain technology, Xpense will record all consumption and behavioral data involved by initially recording data on the side chain or off the chain and finally writing data into the backbone of Xpense data management chain.
